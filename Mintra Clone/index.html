      The spread of computers and layout programmes thus made dummy text better
      known. While in earlier times several lines of the Lorem Ipsum text were
      repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today the full text of Cicero's
      'De finibus' serves as the basis for many dummy text or Lorem Ipsum
      generators. Based on 'De finibus', these generators automatically create
      longer sections of the Lorem Ipsum text or various other filler texts.The
      phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum text is now so widespread and
      commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy text using the
      starting sequence "Lorem ipsum". Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum' is
      now recognized by electronic pre-press systems and, when found, an alarm
      can be raised. This avoids a publication going to print with overlooked
      dummy text.Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text
      cannot be recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful information
      cannot be distinguished from meaningless: Target-generated dummy text
      mixed with a certain combination of search terms can lead to an increased
      frequency of visits by search machine users. As a consequence, advertising
      revenues, which rely on website 'hits', are increased.
