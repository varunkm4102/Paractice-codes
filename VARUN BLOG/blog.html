          How I Learned Java in Depth by preparing for Java Technical Interviews
        </h1>
        <div class="new-content">
          Iassume my readers are mostly Java Developer professionals or
          developers, Who are seeking to expand their knowledge base so that
          they can excel in their current or next role. How My Java Interview
          prep helped me to learn more in depth When I started working as a
          Junior Java dev back in my initial days, early in my career. Whenever
          I was working on a task, I used to do a lot of googling for every
          coding logic that I can find over the internet. I was more of a stack
          overflow engineer. Having a mentor in the early days is a very
          fortunate thing to have. They can guide you correctly rather than
          spending more time googling and completing the task. But I was not
          that lucky on that front. When I started hunting for my next job, I
          got a lot of rejections and humiliation in technical rounds, because
          whatever I have learned was superficial only. After a few months of
          preparation and facing the interviews, I got to know the value of five
          things that makes the difference in the technical interview and that
          was, Reading Java API documentation helped to understand the
          underlying API of JDK. like how they internally work, and what time
          and space complexities they have when we use them in code. Reading
          good books on Java like Head First Java and Effective java built my
          Object-oriented programming basics plus added a base to my Java
          knowledge. I assure you these books will definitely lay a strong
          foundation for your profile. here is the link for these books that you
          can refer — Java Books 3. When we work on a project we don't pay
          attention to what is the best practices we should be following while
          writing code. we were solely focusing on getting the job done. We
          always write code in a brute force way and not in an optimized way if
          you working for NON-FAANG companies. In a coding interview, I have
          been always asked about the optimized code. So solving coding
          puzzles/problems on leetcode and hacker rank helped me to write better
          code. 4. Design patterns and System design questions were asked most
          of the time. While facing the interview I got to know the importance
          of them and I have added them to my knowledge base as well 5.
          Importance of Unit testing, sometimes interviewers test your unit
          testing knowledge. I had to learn the Junit framework in depth because
          of that. Topics which i learned in Depth while preparing java
          technical interview Core Java API (Collection framework, Stream, Java
          Lang Package, Java Util Package, Java Time Package, Java IO Package,
          Java net Package, Java SQL Package) Design patterns (Builder, factory,
          proxy, adaptor, facade, observer design patterns)with examples. SOLID
          Design principles with their practical use in coding. Read Clean code
          and clean coder of uncle bob which added clean coding habits (fewer
          WTFs in my Code reviews after that :) Spring Framework, Hibernate
          framework, and JPA in depth A unit testing framework that I have
          learned was, J-UNIT, MOCKITO, and POWER MOCK. which helped to clear
          the code coverage criteria in my pipeline. Unless I have given the
          interviews I would not have studied the above topics in depth which
          are very important as a developer. After learning all of those in a
          theoretical and practical way I was able to clear more technical
          rounds and I was able to triple my salary in less time span. also, I
          was recognized in my next role as a Strong technical resource. One of
          the comments that my manager gave me in my appraisal was. “Ajay is
          Technically very good and he provides quality code in a timely
          manner”. That was encouraging to me, how your preparation also makes
          you a good developer. I hope this helps my fellow readers in their
          path.
